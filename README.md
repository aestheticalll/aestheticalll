henlo, im gavin. i am a 15 year old hobbyist programmer. i mostly do java, but am learning kotlin. anywhoozies, heres some shit i've done:

- Java (pretty obvious if you look at my repos)
- Kotlin (i dont remember shit, i should really re-learn it)
- JavaScript (cringe)
- TypeScript (although its a superset of JavaScript, idrc)
- C (i still dont understand pointers lul)
- Python (not advanced, just enough to get me around)

now that you know what languages i have done some shit with, here's some shit im working on:

- [saturn-client](https://github.com/Sxmurai/saturn-client) a client for 1.18.1 that is meant for strict servers (rn its shit but im working on it)
- [nebula](https://github.com/Sxmurai/nebula) my new anarchy client
- [inferno](https://github.com/Sxmurai/inferno) dead project lelsauce
- [cosmos](https://github.com/momentumdevelopment/cosmos) im a dev for this client, fun to work on
- [observant](https://github.com/Sxmurai/observant) a *really* shitty anticheat just for fun, not expecting to really get anywhere
- [aesthetirat](https://github.com/Sxmurai/aesthetirat) a fun little project for fun and "educational purposes"

now that ive been through shit ive made or helped make, heres some less important repos that ive done shit with

- [3arthh4ck](https://github.com/Sxmurai/3arthh4ck-Future) i didnt make 3arthh4ck, but this repo fixes compatability with Future v2.12 (and v2.13 havent tested)
- [learning-c](https://github.com/Sxmurai/learning-c) me learning C, so dont expect top tier code
- [client-collection](https://github.com/Sxmurai/client-collection) a repo full of JARs or leaked client srcs for fun
